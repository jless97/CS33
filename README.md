## Course Description
Introductory course on computer architecture, assembly language, and operating systems fundamentals. Number systems, machine language, and assembly language. Procedure calls, stacks, interrupts, and traps. Assemblers, linkers, and loaders. Operating systems concepts: processes and process management, input/output (I/O) programming, memory management, file systems.

### Project Overviews
* P1 - Data Lab
  * The idea is to familiarize yourself with bit-level integer representation by solving a set of programming puzzles.
* P2 - Program Execution Explorer Lab
  * The idea is that a debugger like GDB is better thought of as a way of exploring program execution histories than merely as a debugger. Gather and analyze instruction traces.
* P3 - Smashling Lab
  * This assignment investigates an old-fashioned way of breaking into systems executing x86 machine code, along with a couple of machine-level defenses against this attack. Gives a general idea of how an attacker can break into a system by exploiting behavior that is undefined at the C level but defined at the machine level, and what we can do about it at the machine level
* P4 - OpenMP Lab
  * Basic idea is to use OpenMP to make a program go faster
