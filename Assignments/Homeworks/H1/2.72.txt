Problem 2.72

(A)	The conditional statement never evaluates to less than zero in the 
	original code. This is because the sizeof() operator returns a 
	size_t type, which is an unsigned value. Thus, the conditional
	statement will be implicitly converted to unsigned, which results
	in the statement never being negative. The unsigned value is the
	reason why the value is always copied to the buffer, even when
	maxbytes is too small.

(B)	Rewritten conditional statement:
	
	if (maxbytes >= sizeof(val))
